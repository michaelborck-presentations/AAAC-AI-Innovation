# The Business Innovation Imperative

> "AI isn't just a technology upgrade—it's a fundamental business transformation catalyst."

- Every industry faces disruption—agriculture provides compelling transformation examples
- AI adoption represents a strategic business decision, not just a technology implementation
- Business leaders must understand innovation frameworks to guide AI implementation
- Today's focus: How to apply business innovation frameworks to AI deployment in any sector

::: {.notes}

- This quote frames our entire approach today - AI is about business transformation, not just technology
- Agriculture provides excellent examples because the industry is seeing dramatic and visible change
- What's happening in agriculture is a microcosm of broader business transformation
- Many organisations approach AI as purely technical - this is a fundamental mistake
- Success requires understanding business innovation frameworks first, then applying technology
- Today I'll show you how to approach AI implementation as a business leader, not just as a technologist
- These frameworks apply to any industry - we're using agriculture as our case study

# PART 1: UNDERSTANDING AI TECHNOLOGIES

::: {.notes}

- Before diving into business frameworks, let's establish a common understanding of AI technologies
- The goal here is to demystify AI - it's not magic, but understandable technology with clear principles
- Understanding these basics helps business leaders make more informed strategic decisions
- This foundation will make the business frameworks more meaningful and applicable
:::



# Demystifying AI: Core Technologies

**Making AI Understandable for Business Leaders:**

- **Machine Learning:** Systems that improve through experience
- **Deep Learning:** Advanced pattern recognition using neural networks
- **Computer Vision:** Enabling machines to "see" and interpret visual information
- **Natural Language Processing:** Understanding and generating human language
- **Large Language Models:** Advanced systems for complex language tasks
- **AI Agents:** Autonomous systems that can perform tasks with minimal oversight

**Key Business Insight:** Understanding these fundamental technologies helps leaders match business problems with appropriate AI solutions

::: {.notes}

- My goal here is to make AI understandable, not mysterious
- Machine Learning is about systems that learn patterns from data rather than being explicitly programmed
- Think of Deep Learning as the "pattern recognition on steroids" - it can find complex relationships in data
- Computer Vision is why cameras can now "see" - recognising objects, faces, conditions, or defects
- NLP is what enables systems to understand and generate human language
- LLMs like ChatGPT and Claude are the most advanced NLP systems, trained on massive text datasets
- AI Agents are systems that can take actions somewhat independently to accomplish goals
- The key insight is matching problems to technologies - not all AI is suitable for all problems
- Business leaders don't need to be technical experts but should understand these fundamental differences

**The Foundation of Modern AI Applications:**

1. **Data Collection:** Gathering relevant business information
2. **Data Preparation:** Cleaning and organizing for analysis
3. **Algorithm Selection:** Choosing appropriate mathematical approaches
4. **Training:** System learns patterns from historical data
5. **Testing & Validation:** Ensuring accuracy and reliability
6. **Deployment:** Integrating into business workflows
7. **Monitoring & Refinement:** Continuous improvement

**Key Business Insight:** The quality and relevance of your data is the most critical success factor

::: {.notes}

- This slide breaks down how machine learning actually works in a business context
- The process begins with data collection - you need relevant business information to learn from
- Data preparation is often the most time-consuming step - garbage in, garbage out applies here
- Algorithm selection means choosing the right mathematical approach for your specific problem
- The training phase is where the system learnns patterns from historical data
- Testing and validation ensure the system works reliably with new data
- Deployment means integrating the model into actual business workflows
- This isn't "set and forget" - continuous monitoring and refinement is essential
- The Google Cloud case study shows how manufacturing applies these same principles
- The most important insight: data quality and relevance determine success more than algorithm sophistication
- Many businesses fail with AI because they underinvest in data preparation and quality

# Inside Modern AI: Understanding the “Attention” Revolution — In Simple Business Term

- **The Breakthrough**: A 2017 paper called *"Attention is All You Need"* changed how AI works.
- **What Changed**: AI systems can now *look at all the information at once* to find patterns and connections.
- **Business Analogy**: It's like going from solving problems one step at a time to seeing the *whole strategy* at once.
- **Why It Matters**: AI can now understand context, relationships, and what's most relevant — almost like a human.

### How Systems Like GPT Work

- **Pattern Spotting**: They learn by reading huge amounts of text (trillions of words).
- **Prediction Engine**: They guess what comes next in a sentence based on what came before.
- **Fine-Tuning**: They’re trained further to be more accurate and helpful for real-world use.


::: {.notes}

- I want to take a moment to demystify modern AI in simple business terms
- The systems you hear about - ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini - are based on a breakthrough from 2017
- This paper, "Attention is All You Need," revolutionised AI by introducing the Transformer architecture
- Previous AI systems processed information sequentially - like reading a book one word at a time and constantly forgetting
- The breakthrough was the "attention mechanism" that lets AI instantly see connections across all information
- It's like the difference between a junior employee who needs to check the manual for every decision versus an experienced executive who instantly connects relevant information
- These modern systems work in three main steps:
- First, they learn patterns from massive datasets - like reading every business document ever written
- Second, they function as prediction engines - you provide the beginning of a pattern, they predict the most appropriate continuation
- Third, they have an alignment layer - additional training to make them helpful, factual, and appropriate
- Understanding this helps business leaders see why these systems are fundamentally different from previous technologies
- They weren't programmed with rules, they learned patterns - which explains both their remarkable capabilities and their limitations
- This isn't just a technical detail - it has profound implications for how you implement AI in your organisation

::: {.notes}
- While I've emphasised AI's transformative potential, it's equally important to understand its real limitations and implementation challenges.

- **Technical Limitations**:
  - Hallucinations remain a significant issue - AI systems confidently generate incorrect information that appears plausible, which creates verification challenges.
  - Current AI has fundamental reasoning limitations, especially with complex logical, mathematical, or causal reasoning tasks.
  - Knowledge cutoffs mean systems lack current information unless specifically integrated with real-time data sources.
  - The black-box nature of large models makes it difficult to understand why specific outputs are generated.
  - These limitations mean human verification remains essential, and we should focus on augmentation rather than full automation.

- **Organisational Challenges**:
  - The skills gap isn't just technical - it includes the business capabilities needed to identify valuable use cases and manage implementation.
  - Integration with existing systems is often more challenging than the AI technology itself.
  - Data quality issues frequently derail AI initiatives - algorithms can't overcome fundamentally flawed data.
  - McKinsey research shows that 80% of AI initiatives struggle to move beyond pilot phase due to these organisational barriers.
  - The practical approach is starting with targeted use cases that have clear value and building from there.

- **Ethical and Risk Dimensions**:
  - Bias amplification occurs when AI systems learn from and then magnify existing biases in training data.
  - Privacy concerns include both the data needed to train systems and the potential exposure of sensitive information in outputs.
  - Regulatory landscape is evolving rapidly, creating compliance uncertainty and potential legal exposure.
  - The environmental impact of large AI models is substantial - training a single large model can generate as much carbon as five cars over their lifetimes.
  - Organisations need proactive governance frameworks that address these concerns before they become problems.

- **Key Takeaway**:
  - Successful AI implementation requires clear-eyed recognition of these limitations.
  - The frameworks we've discussed provide structure for navigating these challenges.
  - Organisations that acknowledge and plan for these limitations ultimately achieve better results than those with unrealistic expectations.
  - This isn't about dampening enthusiasm but ensuring that it's channeled productively.

# Computer Vision in Business

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Enabling Machines to "See" for Business Value:**

- **How It Works:** Uses neural networks to identify objects, features, and patterns in images/video
- **Common Techniques:** Object detection, image classification, segmentation, tracking
- **Hardware Requirements:** Specialised processors (GPUs) for efficient processing
- **Deployment Options:** Edge devices, cloud processing, hybrid approaches

**Agricultural Application:** Smart spraying systems that reduce herbicide use by 80-96% by identifying individual weeds [Source: ABC News, "AI helps Aussie farmers target weeds," 2024](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-12/artificial-intelligence-agriculture-boom-australia-rural/104450732)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![Computer Vision Example](./computer-vision.png)
:::
:::

::: {.notes}

- Computer vision enables machines to "see" and interpret visual information
- At its core, neural networks analyse pixel patterns to identify objects and features
- It works through techniques like object detection (finding things), classification (identifying what they are), segmentation (outlining objects precisely), and tracking (following objects over time)
- These systems typically require specialised hardware - regular computers struggle with this processing
- Deployment can happen on-device (edge), in the cloud, or in hybrid approaches
- The agricultural example is powerful - smart spraying systems use computer vision to only spray herbicide on weeds, not crops
- The 80-96% reduction in herbicide use is not just environmental but has massive cost implications
- This technology applies across industries - manufacturing quality control, retail analytics, security
- The Microsoft FarmBeats case study provides additional context on real-world applications
- The business value extends far beyond the technical capabilities - it transforms operations

# Natural Language Processing & LLMs

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Transforming How Businesses Work with Language:**

- **How NLP Works:** Analyses, understands and generates human language
- **Key Capabilities:** Sentiment analysis, information extraction, summarisation, translation
- **How LLMs Work:** Trained on massive text datasets to predict and generate human-like text
- **Business Applications:** Content generation, research assistance, customer service, decision support

**Agricultural Application:** Farm management planning tools that process complex regulations and research
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![NLP Capabilities Diagram](./nlp-processing.png)
:::
:::


::: {.notes}

- Natural Language Processing represents one of the most transformative AI capabilities for business
- At a basic level, NLP analyses and understands human language through complex pattern recognition
- Traditional capabilities include sentiment analysis (understanding emotion), information extraction (pulling key facts), summarisation, and translation
- Large Language Models like ChatGPT and Claude represent a quantum leap in capabilities
- LLMs work by being trained on massive text datasets to predict what text should come next
- This predictive capability allows them to generate remarkably human-like text and reasoning
- Business applications are extensive - content creation, research analysis, customer service, and decision support
- The agricultural example shows how LLMs can process complex regulations and research that would overwhelm humans
- This same capability applies to legal compliance, market research, and competitive intelligence in any industry
- The Deloitte guide provides implementation frameworks that transfer across business domains
- The key business insight is that LLMs are most valuable when integrating human expertise with AI capabilities

# AI Agents & Autonomous Systems

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Business Applications of Self-Directing AI:**

- **How They Work:** Systems that can sense, decide, and act with minimal human intervention
- **Key Components:** Perception modules, decision-making logic, action capabilities
- **Implementation Approaches:** Rules-based, learning-based, hybrid systems
- **Current Limitations:** Defined scope, supervision requirements, handling exceptions

**Agricultural Application:** Autonomous tractors and harvesters in "hands-free" farming operations
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![AI Agent Architecture](./ai-agent-arch.png)
:::
:::



::: {.notes}

- AI agents represent the frontier of business applications - systems that can independently pursue objectives
- They work by combining three key capabilities: sensing (perceiving the environment), deciding (choosing actions), and acting (implementing decisions)
- The architecture typically includes perception modules that interpret the world, decision logic that determines actions, and capabilities to carry out those actions
- Implementation can be rules-based (following predefined instructions), learning-based (adapting through experience), or hybrid
- Current limitations are important to understand - most agents work within defined scopes, require supervision, and struggle with exceptional cases
- The agricultural example of autonomous tractors shows this in action - they can perform complex field operations with minimal supervision
- This same principle applies to autonomous systems in manufacturing, logistics, customer service, and financial operations
- The McKinsey case study provides a broader business perspective on implementation approaches
- The key insight is that autonomous systems aren't about replacing humans but augmenting capabilities and freeing people for higher-value work
- The most successful implementations start with narrow, well-defined applications before expanding scope
:::



# PART 2: BUSINESS INNOVATION FRAMEWORKS

::: {.notes}

- Now that we have a common understanding of AI technologies, let's explore business innovation frameworks
- These frameworks help structure your approach to AI implementation
- The goal is to move from technology-driven implementation to business-driven transformation
- Each framework provides a different lens for approaching AI innovation
- I'll show how these frameworks apply to agricultural examples, but they're universally applicable
:::



# The AI Transformation Matrix


::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Four Quadrants of Business Impact:**

|                          | Incremental      | Transformational               |
| -- | -- | -- |
| **Process Improvement**  | Efficiency Gains | Business Process Reengineering |
| **Strategic Innovation** | New Capabilities | Business Model Reinvention     |

**Agricultural Example:**

- Smart spraying (80-96% chemical reduction) started as efficiency gain but led to business model reinvention through sustainability certification premiums
- [Source: ABC News, "AI helps Aussie farmers target weeds," 2024](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-12/artificial-intelligence-agriculture-boom-australia-rural/104450732)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](ai-transformation-matrix.png)
:::
:::

::: {.notes}

- The AI Transformation Matrix helps organisations map their AI initiatives based on impact type and scale
- The vertical axis represents the focus - are you improving processes or creating strategic innovation?
- The horisontal axis represents the magnitude - are the changes incremental or transformational?
- Most organisations start in the upper left - efficiency gains - which is appropriate but limited
- The smart spraying example shows the journey across this matrix
- It began as an efficiency play - reducing herbicide costs by 80-96% by only spraying actual weeds
- But it evolved into business model reinvention - enabling premium pricing through sustainability certification
- This pattern applies across industries - what starts as efficiency often leads to transformation
- The most successful organisations deliberately plan movement across this matrix over time
- The Deloitte framework provides additional context on implementing this approach
- This matrix helps executives communicate the strategic intent of AI initiatives and set appropriate expectations
- Ask yourself: Where do your current AI initiatives fall? Are you limiting yourself to the efficiency quadrant?
:::



# The Data Value Pyramid

**Turning Information into Business Value:**

1. **Descriptive Analytics:** What happened? (Data collection)
2. **Diagnostic Analytics:** Why did it happen? (Data interpretation)
3. **Predictive Analytics:** What will happen? (Data forecasting)
4. **Prescriptive Analytics:** What should we do? (Data-driven decisions)
5. **Cognitive Analytics:** Self-optimising systems (Autonomous operations)

**Agricultural Example:** Livestock monitoring evolution from basic tracking → health predictions → autonomous intervention systems

- [Source: CSIRO, "Ceres Tag smart ear tags," 2023](https://www.csiro.au/en/research/animals/livestock/ceres-tag)

::: {.notes}

- The Data Value Pyramid shows how organisations extract increasing value from their data
- Most organisations start at the bottom with descriptive analytics - simply understanding what happened
- Diagnostic analytics adds interpretation - why did these events occur?
- Predictive analytics moves into forecasting - what is likely to happen next?
- Prescriptive analytics recommends actions - what should we do about it?
- Cognitive analytics represents the frontier - systems that can optimise themselves
- The livestock monitoring example shows this evolution perfectly
- It began with basic GPS tracking of cattle (descriptive - where are they?)
- Advanced to health monitoring that could diagnose issues (why is this animal behaving differently?)
- Then to predictive systems that could forecast health problems before visible symptoms
- Now moving toward systems that can prescribe and even implement interventions
- This same progression applies to any data-driven business function
- The key insight: higher levels of the pyramid deliver exponentially more business value
- Most organisations get stuck at descriptive/diagnostic levels and never realise the full potential
- The Gartner model provides a framework for assessing your current maturity and planning advancement
- Where is your organisation on this pyramid? What would it take to move up one level?

# The Innovation Adoption Framework

**Five Business Implementation Phases:**

1. **Knowledge Building:** Understanding potential and possibilities
2. **Strategic Alignment:** Connecting AI to business objectives
3. **Capability Development:** Building human and technical resources
4. **Pilot Implementation:** Testing and proving value
5. **Organisational Transformation:** Scaling and integrating across business

**Agricultural Example:** How Digital Agriculture Services (DAS) progressed through these phases when implementing their crop forecasting system
- [Additional coverage: IT Brief article](https://itbrief.com.au/story/das-uses-ai-to-reveal-varying-australian-crop-yields)

::: {.notes}

- The Innovation Adoption Framework provides a roadmap for implementing AI in organisations
- Phase 1 is Knowledge Building - understanding what's possible before making commitments
- Phase 2 is Strategic Alignment - connecting AI initiatives to specific business objectives
- Phase 3 is Capability Development - building or acquiring the needed skills and technologies
- Phase 4 is Pilot Implementation - testing in controlled environments to demonstrate value
- Phase 5 is Organisational Transformation - scaling successful approaches across the business
- The Digital Agriculture Services example illustrates this progression
- They began by building knowledge about how satellite imagery and ML could predict crop yields
- They aligned this with strategic business needs in agricultural insurance and investment
- They developed capabilities by building data science teams and satellite imagery processing
- Their pilot implementations tested predictions against ground-truth data in specific regions
- Now they're transforming the agricultural intelligence landscape at organisational scale
- This framework applies to any significant innovation initiative, not just AI
- The key insight: skipping phases often leads to implementation failure
- Many organisations jump straight to pilots without strategic alignment or capability building
- The KPMG framework provides additional detail on implementing each phase
- What phase is your organisation currently in? Are you trying to skip essential steps?

# The AI Investment Model

**Calculating Return on AI Investment:**

- **Cost Considerations:** Implementation, integration, training, maintenance
- **Value Categories:** Efficiency gains, new capabilities, risk reduction, market differentiation
- **Measuring Success:** KPIs, benchmarks, and value capture mechanisms
- **Timeline Expectations:** Short-term wins vs. long-term transformation

**Agricultural Example:** AgBot II autonomous weeding robot's ROI calculation model and payback period analysis

- [Source: Queensland University of Technology, "AgBot II Robot for Farm Weed Management"](https://research.qut.edu.au/qcr/Projects/agbot-ii-robotic-site-specific-crop-and-weed-management-tool/)


::: {.notes}

- The AI Investment Model provides a framework for calculating the business value of AI initiatives
- Cost considerations include not just implementation but integration with existing systems, staff training, and ongoing maintenance
- Value categories are diverse - efficiency gains are most obvious, but new capabilities, risk reduction, and market differentiation often deliver greater value
- Measuring success requires specific KPIs tailored to your business objectives
- Timeline expectations are crucial - some benefits appear quickly while transformational value takes longer
- The AgBot II example demonstrates this comprehensive approach to ROI calculation
- Initial costs included development, manufacturing, and implementation
- Value categories included reduced herbicide costs, labor savings, and yield improvements
- Their measurement approach compared traditional methods to autonomous operations
- Timeline expectations recognised short-term operational savings and long-term transformation of weed management
- The projected AU$1.3 billion national impact shows the scaling potential
- This same model applies to AI investments in any business domain
- The key insight: comprehensive ROI calculations require looking beyond obvious cost savings
- Most organisations underestimate both costs (especially integration) and benefits (especially strategic value)
- The HBR article provides additional frameworks for calculating generative AI ROI
- How comprehensive is your current approach to AI investment calculations?
:::



# PART 3: IMPLEMENTING AI INNOVATION STRATEGIES

::: {.notes}

- Now let's move from frameworks and case studies to specific implementation strategies
- These strategies provide practical approaches to applying the frameworks we've discussed
- Each strategy addresses a different aspect of successful AI implementation
- Together, they form a comprehensive toolkit for business leaders
- Again, while our examples are agricultural, these strategies apply universally
:::

**Additional Coverage:** [ABC News: Automated Farm](https://www.abc.net.au/news/rural/2021-05-27/automated-farm-to-use-robots-and-artificial-intelligence/100169302)


::: {.notes}

- The Business Model Canvas provides a structured approach to integrating AI into business models
- Problem-Solution Fit ensures you're addressing actual business challenges, not just deploying technology
- The Value Proposition Canvas helps articulate exactly what value AI adds for customers and the business
- Resource Assessment identifies capability gaps in technology, data, expertise, and infrastructure
- Cost-Benefit Structure creates a comprehensive model of investment and returns
- The Wagga Wagga "hands-free" farm applied this approach to autonomous farming
- They identified specific problems - labor shortages, precision limitations, and management complexity
- Their value proposition focused on higher yields, reduced inputs, and consistent quality
- Their resource assessment identified gaps in technical infrastructure and staff capabilities
- Their cost-benefit structure modeled initial investment against multi-year productivity gains
- This systematic approach helped secure funding and stakeholder support
- The same canvas framework applies to AI integration in any industry
- The key insight: successful AI implementation begins with business model clarity, not technology selection
- The Strategyser reference provides templates and examples for applying this canvas
- How might this canvas help structure your organisation's approach to AI integration?

**Framework Reference:** [Lean Startup Methodology](https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything)

::: {.notes}

- The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Approach applies lean startup methodology to AI implementation
- Scope Definition means selecting a narrow, high-impact use case for initial implementation
- Success Metrics establish clear, measurable KPIs tied directly to business outcomes
- Feedback Loops create structured mechanisms for learning and adaptation
- The Scaling Plan maps the path from successful pilot to enterprise-wide implementation
- CQUniversity applied this approach to their weed-targeting drone project
- They defined a narrow initial scope - identifying a single weed species in sorghum crops
- Their success metrics included detection accuracy, reduction in herbicide use, and time savings
- They established feedback loops through field testing and farmer interviews
- Their scaling plan expanded to additional weed species, crop types, and geographic regions
- This staged approach reduced risk while demonstrating value at each step
- The same MVP methodology applies to AI implementation in any domain
- The key insight: starting small but strategically creates momentum and builds credibility
- Many organisations fail by attempting too much too soon without proving value
- The Lean Startup reference provides additional context on applying this methodology
- Could your organisation benefit from a more focused MVP approach to AI implementation?

- The Technology Democratisation Model addresses how to make AI accessible across organisation sises
- Access Mechanisms are approaches that enable smaller businesses to leverage advanced AI
- Capability Building focuses on community-based knowledge sharing and skill development
- Cooperative Models enable shared resources and infrastructure to distribute costs
- Policy Considerations address ecosystem development to support inclusive innovation
- The family farm cooperative example demonstrates this approach
- Access mechanisms included subscription-based AI services with minimal upfront investment
- Capability building happened through farmer-to-farmer knowledge networks
- Cooperative models shared equipment costs and data infrastructure
- Policy advocacy influenced research funding and connectivity infrastructure
- This democratic approach ensured benefits weren't limited to the largest players
- The same model applies to technology democratisation in any industry
- The key insight: inclusive innovation approaches strengthen entire ecosystems
- Organisations that support democratisation often benefit from network effects and ecosystem growth
- The WEF framework provides additional context on inclusive technology development
- How might your organisation contribute to more democratic access to AI capabilities?

# PART 5: FUTURE BUSINESS HORIsONS

::: {.notes}

- Let's look at how to strategically plan for future AI developments
- The goal is to build a balanced portfolio of innovation initiatives
- This helps organisations manage risk while capturing emerging opportunities
- The Three Horisons model provides a framework for this strategic planning
- It's about managing the present while building the future
:::



# The Three Horisons of AI Innovation

**Business Planning Framework:**

- **Horison 1 (Next 2 Years):** Extending and defending core business

  - Implementing proven AI technologies for immediate gains
  - Example: Smartphone-based decision support tools
  - [Source: iGrowNews, "Australian Farmers Embrace AgTech," 2024](https://igrownews.com/australian-farmers-embrace-agtech-overcoming-key-barriers/)

- **Horison 2 (2-5 Years):** Building emerging opportunities

  - Investing in developing capabilities and new business models
  - Example: Integrated "smart farm" management systems

- **Horison 3 (5-10 Years):** Creating viable options for future business
  - Exploring breakthrough possibilities and industry transformation
  - Example: Autonomous farms with minimal human intervention

**Key Business Insight:** Balanced investment portfolio across all three horisons is essential for sustainable innovation


::: {.notes}

- The Three Horisons model provides a framework for balanced innovation planning
- Horison 1 focuses on the next 2 years - extending and defending the core business
- This includes implementing proven AI technologies for immediate business gains
- In agriculture, this means smartphone-based decision support tools already being adopted
- Horison 2 looks at the 2-5 year timeframe - building emerging opportunities
- This involves developing capabilities and new business models with growing evidence
- The integrated "smart farm" systems represent this horison - proven in concept but not yet mainstream
- Horison 3 addresses the 5-10 year future - creating viable options for future business
- This explores breakthrough possibilities that could transform industries
- Fully autonomous farming operations exemplify this horison - technically possible but not yet practical
- The key insight is that organisations need a balanced portfolio across all three horisons
- Most organisations overinvest in Horison 1 and underinvest in Horisons 2 and 3
- This leaves them vulnerable to disruption and missing future opportunities
- The McKinsey model provides additional guidance on portfolio allocation
- How balanced is your organisation's innovation portfolio across these three horisons?

# AI Next 2 years

| Time Horizon | Technical Evolution | Business Impact | Society & Governance |
|--|--|--|-|
| **Next 2 Years**<br>(2025-2027)<br>*Expansion & Consolidation* | • Advanced multimodal models<br>• Smaller, efficient models for edge devices<br>• Domain-specialised AI systems<br>• Early agentic AI | • Productivity gains in knowledge work<br>• Integration into enterprise workflows<br>• Software development disruption<br>• Focus on ROI and practical applications | • First comprehensive AI regulations<br>• Growing emphasis on transparency<br>• AI literacy becoming essential<br>• Educational adaptation |

::: {.notes}
- This timeline provides a strategic perspective on AI evolution over the next decade, organised using the Three Horizons framework we discussed earlier.

- **For the Next 2 Years (2025-2027) - "Expansion & Consolidation"**:
  - Technically, we're seeing multimodal models becoming standard, not just handling text but processing and generating across multiple formats simultaneously.
  - The business focus is pragmatic - organisations are prioritising measurable ROI and practical applications rather than experimental use cases.
  - The key development in governance is the implementation of first-generation comprehensive regulations, similar to what we're seeing with the EU AI Act but with global variations.
  - This period represents enhancement of current business models rather than fundamental transformation.

# AI Next 2-5 yrs

| Time Horizon | Technical Evolution | Business Impact | Society & Governance |
|--|--|--|-|
| **2-5 Years**<br>(2027-2030)<br>*Systems Integration & Transformation* | • AI agents with memory and reasoning<br>• Personalised AI assistants<br>• AI-native applications<br>• Next-gen hardware deployment | • "Co-pilot for everything" reality<br>• Major industry disruption<br>• Job transformation<br>• New AI-enabled business models | • Mature international standards<br>• Ethical governance frameworks<br>• AI accelerating scientific discovery<br>• Workforce reskilling priority |


::: {.notes}
- **For the Medium Term (2027-2030) - "Systems Integration & Transformation"**:
  - The technical evolution moves toward truly agentic systems - AI that can reason across context, maintain memory, and operate with limited autonomy.
  - Business impact shifts from enhancing current processes to transforming them - we'll see "co-pilots" for virtually every knowledge work domain.
  - This will drive significant job transformation - not primarily elimination but redefinition of roles around AI collaboration.
  - Governance frameworks mature from reactive to proactive, with established international standards similar to what we've seen with data privacy.

# AI Next 5-10 yrs

| Time Horizon | Technical Evolution | Business Impact | Society & Governance |
|--|--|--|-|
| **5-10 Years**<br>(2030-2035)<br>*AI-Native Society & Reinvention* | • General-purpose AI systems<br>• Potential AGI emergence<br>• Quantum-AI synergies<br>• Advanced human-AI interfaces | • Economic structural changes<br>• High-level cognitive automation<br>• New career categories<br>• AI as critical infrastructure | • Global AI governance treaties<br>• Redefined creativity concepts<br>• Existential risk management<br>• Philosophical reassessment |

::: {.notes}
- **For the Long Term (2030-2035) - "AI-Native Society & Reinvention"**:
  - While I've included potential AGI emergence, this remains speculative - what's more certain is the development of increasingly general-purpose systems.
  - The business landscape undergoes structural changes as AI becomes critical infrastructure - similar to how the internet transformed from advantage to necessity.
  - We'll likely see entirely new career categories emerge rather than just automation of existing ones.
  - Governance shifts to treaty-level international frameworks addressing existential concerns.
  - This period also brings deeper philosophical questions about human-AI relationships and creativity.

- **Key Strategic Implications**:
  - Organisations need balanced investment portfolios across all three horizons.
  - Near-term focus should be on practical applications with measurable ROI.
  - Medium-term planning should involve business model innovation and workforce transformation.
  - Long-term vision should consider fundamental shifts in how value is created and delivered.
  - Each industry will experience this timeline differently, with some sectors transforming faster than others.

- **For Your Organisation**:
  - Consider where your current AI initiatives fall on this timeline.
  - Are you overly focused on Horizon 1 at the expense of preparing for Horizons 2 and 3?
  - Have you considered the talent and capability implications of each horizon?
  - How might your competitive landscape change as AI evolves across these timeframes?

# Conclusion: Your Strategic AI Innovation Journey

- AI implementation is fundamentally a business transformation opportunity
- Strategic frameworks transform technology potential into business value
- The path from concept to implementation requires structured approaches
- Your competitive advantage lies in how you implement, not just what you implement

> "The organisations that thrive won't merely adopt AI technologies—they'll master the frameworks that transform those technologies into strategic advantage."

::: {.notes}
- As we conclude our exploration of AI-driven business innovation, I want to emphasise the tremendous opportunity ahead
- Throughout this masterclass, we've seen that successful AI implementation isn't primarily a technical challenge—it's a strategic business transformation opportunity
- The frameworks we've explored today provide the architecture for that transformation, regardless of your industry or organisation size
- While we've drawn examples from agriculture for their clarity and impact, these same frameworks apply whether you're in manufacturing, healthcare, finance, retail, or any other sector
- The agricultural examples demonstrate how the same technology can yield dramatically different outcomes based on implementation approach
- I encourage you to reflect on which frameworks resonate most with your specific business challenges:
  - Perhaps the AI Transformation Matrix helps you map your current initiatives
  - Or the Three Horizons model provides structure for your innovation portfolio
  - Or the Data Value Pyramid helps articulate your analytics progression
- What makes these frameworks powerful is their ability to create organisational alignment, focus resources, and build sustainable capability
- Organisations with identical access to AI technologies achieve vastly different results based on how strategically they implement
- As you consider your next steps:
  - Which framework will you apply first in your organisation?
  - What immediate opportunity do you see to create value?
  - How might you build a more structured approach to AI innovation?
- The future belongs to organisations that master not just the technology but the strategic frameworks that guide implementation
- I'm excited to see the innovation journeys you'll embark on, and I welcome your questions about applying these frameworks to your specific challenges
- Thank you for your engagement today
