## Strategic Positioning Matrix for LLMs

### Positioning LLMs in Your Technology Strategy

| | Tactical Implementation | Strategic Integration |
|---|---|---|
| **Strategic Implementation Framework:**
- Take advantage of its multimodal capabilities by sharing business visuals
- Excellent integration with other Google tools businesses might use
- Stronger capabilities for calculations and quantitative business analysis
- Good at generating charts and visual representations of business data

**Agricultural Example:** Analyze images of crop diseases or pests for identification

## Business Framework: The AI Agent Maturity Model

### Understanding Agent Implementation Stages

#### 1. Assisted Tools (Human-Directed)
**Business Characteristics:**
- Require explicit human prompting for each task
- Perform discrete, bounded operations
- Deliver results for human interpretation

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Low implementation complexity
- High control and oversight
- Limited autonomy and continuity

**Agricultural Example:** LLM-assisted crop disease lookup prompted by farmers

#### 2. Semi-Autonomous Agents (Human-Supervised)
**Business Characteristics:**
- Execute sequences of related tasks
- Make routine decisions within defined parameters
- Maintain context across multiple operations

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Moderate implementation complexity
- Balanced control and efficiency
- Defined decision boundaries

**Agricultural Example:** Autonomous agent monitoring commodity prices and sending alerts

#### 3. Autonomous Systems (Human-Overseen)
**Business Characteristics:**
- Independently pursue business objectives
- Make complex decisions based on multiple factors
- Coordinate actions across multiple domains

**Implementation Considerations:**
- High implementation complexity
- Focus on guardrails and oversight mechanisms
- Significant autonomy with defined constraints

**Agricultural Example:** Multi-agent systems managing entire crop cycles

### Business Value Scaling with Agent Autonomy
| Autonomy Level | Efficiency Gain | Implementation Complexity | Risk Profile | Required Oversight |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Assisted Tools** | 10-30% | Low | Low | Continuous |
| **Semi-Autonomous** | 30-60% | Medium | Medium | Periodic |
| **Autonomous** | 60-90% | High | High | Systematic |
