## Implementation Strategy Framework

### Value-First Implementation Model

The following framework provides a structured approach to implementing AI tools across your organisation:

1. **Value Identification**
   * Map specific business pain points to potential AI solutions
   * Quantify current costs/inefficiencies in target processes
   * Establish clear success metrics before implementation

2. **Capability Assessment**
   * Evaluate data readiness for AI implementation
   * Assess technical infrastructure requirements
   * Identify skill gaps in the organisation

3. **Staged Deployment**
   * Begin with proof-of-concept in controlled environment
   * Expand to limited production deployment
   * Scale successful implementations across business units

4. **Change Management**
   * Develop communication strategy for stakeholders
   * Create training and support infrastructure
   * Address concerns about process changes proactively

5. **Value Measurement**
   * Implement before/after measurement of key metrics
   * Capture both quantitative and qualitative outcomes
   * Refine approach based on measured results

### Implementation Readiness Assessment

For each AI tool under consideration, evaluate readiness across these dimensions:

| Dimension | Questions to Address | Ideal State |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Data Readiness** | Is required data available, accessible, and of sufficient quality? | Clean, structured data available in sufficient volume |
| **Process Definition** | How well-defined is the current process being enhanced? | Process is documented with clear inputs and outputs |
| **Integration Requirements** | How will the AI tool connect with existing systems? | APIs or integration paths clearly identified |
| **Expertise Availability** | Does the team have necessary skills to implement and maintain? | Skills available or training path identified |
| **Value Alignment** | How directly does the solution address business priorities? | Clear connection to strategic objectives and KPIs |

### Tool Selection Decision Matrix

When choosing between multiple AI tools for a business need, apply this weighted decision matrix:

1. Identify evaluation criteria (e.g., implementation cost, time to value, ease of use)
2. Assign weights to each criterion based on importance (1-5 scale)
3. Rate each tool on each criterion (1-10 scale)
4. Calculate weighted scores by multiplying weights and ratings
5. Compare total scores to identify optimal solution

**Example Matrix Template:**

| Selection Criteria | Weight (1-5) | Tool A (1-10) | Weighted Score A | Tool B (1-10) | Weighted Score B |
|-------------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Implementation Cost | 4 | | | | |
| Time to Value | 5 | | | | |
| Ease of Use | 3 | | | | |
| Integration Capability | 4 | | | | |
| Scalability | 3 | | | | |
| Support & Training | 3 | | | | |
| **TOTAL** | | | | | |
