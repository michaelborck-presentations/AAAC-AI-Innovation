## Origins, References, and Academic Foundations

This handout provides key references and originating sources for the business innovation frameworks discussed in the AI-Driven Business Innovation masterclass. These references can be used to back up the frameworks' validity and provide further reading on their applications.

## Data Value Pyramid

The Data Value Pyramid represents a widely recognised progression in analytics maturity, from basic descriptive analytics to advanced cognitive systems:

- **Descriptive Analytics:** What happened?
- **Diagnostic Analytics:** Why did it happen?
- **Predictive Analytics:** What will happen?
- **Prescriptive Analytics:** What should we do?
- **Cognitive Analytics:** Self-optimising systems

### Key References

> **Gartner's Analytics Maturity Model**
>
> Gartner's research on analytics maturity provided the foundation for this widely-adopted framework. Their model outlines the progression of analytics capabilities from hindsight to insight to foresight.
>
> _Gartner Research, "Analytics and BI Maturity Model"_

> **INFORMS Analytics Maturity Model**
>
> The Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) developed a comprehensive model for analytics maturity that incorporates organisational readiness, data preparedness, and analytical capabilities.

## Innovation Adoption Framework

The Innovation Adoption Framework describes how new technologies spread through organisations and markets, progressing through distinct phases of adoption and implementation.

### Key References

> **Diffusion of Innovations**
>
> The seminal work on how innovations spread through populations, categorising adopters as Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority, and Laggards. This foundational theory has been applied across countless domains and technologies.
>
> _Everett Rogers, "Diffusion of Innovations" (book, first published 1962, multiple later editions)_

> **Crossing the Chasm**
>
> This influential work adapted Rogers' adoption lifecycle specifically for high-tech products, focusing on the critical "chasm" between Early Adopters and the Early Majority that many technologies fail to cross.
>
> _Geoffrey Moore, "Crossing the Chasm" (book)_

## Capability Maturity Model (CMM / CMMI)

The Capability Maturity Model provides a framework for assessing and improving organisational processes and capabilities through defined maturity levels.

### Key References

> **Software Engineering Institute**
>
> The original Capability Maturity Model was developed at the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University, initially for software development processes but later expanded to other domains.
>
> _Software Engineering Institute (SEI), Carnegie Mellon University_

> **CMMI Institute**
>
> The CMMI Institute (now part of ISACA) administers the Capability Maturity Model Integration framework, which has become the standard for process improvement across multiple industries.

## Business Model Canvas

The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management template for developing new or documenting existing business models, providing a visual chart with elements describing a firm's value proposition, infrastructure, customers, and finances.

### Key References

> **Business Model Generation**
>
> This seminal work introduced the Business Model Canvas as a visual framework for describing, analysing, and designing business models. The canvas has become a standard tool in business strategy and entrepreneurship.

> **Strategyzer**
>
> The official organisation founded by Osterwalder that provides resources and templates for the Business Model Canvas and related strategic tools.
>
> _Strategyzer (co-founded by Alexander Osterwalder)_

## Change Management Models

These models provide frameworks for managing organisational transformation and the human aspects of change implementation.

### Key References

> **Lewin's 3-Stage Model**
>
> This foundational change management model describes change as a process of Unfreezing (preparing for change), Changing (implementing the change), and Refreezing (reinforcing new behaviors).
>
> _Kurt Lewin, psychologist and founder of social psychology_

> **Kotter's 8-Step Process**
>
> This widely-cited model describes eight steps for implementing organisational change: create urgency, form a coalition, create vision, communicate vision, remove obstacles, create short-term wins, build on change, and anchor changes in corporate culture.
>
> _John P. Kotter, "Leading Change" (book, 1996, updated later)_

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The MVP approach focuses on creating the simplest version of a product that delivers value and enables learning, allowing for rapid iteration based on user feedback.

### Key References

> **The Lean Startup**
>
> This influential book popularised the MVP concept as part of the Lean Startup methodology, emphasising validated learning through a build-measure-learn feedback loop.
>
> _Eric Ries, "The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses" (book, 2011)_

## Data Strategy Framework

Data Strategy frameworks provide approaches for organisations to treat data as a strategic asset, covering governance, quality, architecture, and value creation.

### Key References

> **DAMA-DMBOK**
>
> This comprehensive industry reference covers all aspects of data management, including strategy, governance, quality, architecture, security, and more.
>
> _DAMA International, "DAMA-DMBOK: Data Management Body of Knowledge" (guide, multiple editions)_

## Responsible Innovation Framework

The Responsible Innovation Framework provides principles for ensuring that technological innovation considers ethical implications, societal impacts, and long-term consequences.

### Key References

> **Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)**
>
> This framework emphasises transparent, interactive processes that engage various stakeholders to ensure the ethical acceptability, sustainability, and societal desirability of innovation.
>
> _René von Schomberg (formerly European Commission), various publications on Responsible Research and Innovation_

## Technology Democratisation Model

The Technology Democratisation Model addresses how advanced technologies can be made accessible across organisations of various sizes and resource levels.

### Key References

> **The World Is Flat**
>
> While not specifically focused on technology democratisation, this influential book discusses the leveling of the global playing field through technological changes.
>
> _Thomas Friedman, "The World Is Flat" (book)_

> **Gartner on Data Democratisation**
>
> Gartner's research on data democratisation provides insights into making data and analytics accessible to non-technical users across organisations.
>
> _Gartner Research, various reports on data democratisation_

## Three Horizons of Growth

This strategic framework categorises innovation initiatives into three horizons: H1 (extending and defending core business), H2 (building emerging opportunities), and H3 (creating viable options for future business).

### Key References

> **The Alchemy of Growth**
